0.  A lung disease caused by the inhalation of very fine silica dust, causing inflammation in the lungs. The word "silicosis" also describes this illness, but it's not so funny.
1.  It returns resource usage measures for a process(es), like CPU time and memory used.
2.  There are 16 members in a structure.
3.  If we pass them by value, whole two structures will be copied into 'calculate' - that's a waisting of time and resources.
4.  After loading a textfile and a dictionary, main() function starts reading a text symbol-by-symbol, with a goal of constructing separate words. A word is completed when one or more alphabetic symbols are read, and we encounted a non-alphanumeric character (like spacebar, or newline). Then we check our word for misspellings, reset the word index to zero, and continue the symbol reading loop. If we encounter a digit, or a string tends to be too long, we traverse this word in the text, but we won't check it for misspellings.
5.  There are several problems with fscanf - first, you must allocate a memory for a string before reading it from file, and there are no limits of a length of a word in a text file. Also you can't write program logic for skipping alphanumeric words, like this implementation of speller has. Overall, this approach gives us much less flexibility.
6.  Those parameters are never intented to be modified in the functions, so we wrote an other layer of ensuring this behavior.
